        "# Training an Intrusion Detection System with KDD99\n",
        "\n",
        "The [KDD-99 dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) is very famous in the security field and almost a \"hello world\" of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in machine learning. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a program that monitors computers and network systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported to an administrator or collected centrally. IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. Although the KDD99 dataset is over 20 years old, it is still widely used to demonstrate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). KDD99 is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99, The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between \"bad\" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and \"good\" normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, including various intrusions simulated in a military network environment.\n",

        "The following code reads the KDD99 CSV dataset into a Pandas data frame. The standard format of KDD99 does not include column names. Because of that, the program adds them."
